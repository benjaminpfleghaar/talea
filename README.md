## Description

ADHD is a complex neurological condition, making it difficult to explain â€” especially to children. Talea bridges the gap by using AI to generate personalized stories. Through these stories, patients can identify with the main character, gaining a deeper understanding of themselves, their symptoms, and ADHD as a whole.
